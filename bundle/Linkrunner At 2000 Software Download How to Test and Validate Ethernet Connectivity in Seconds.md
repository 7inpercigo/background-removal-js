The LinkRunner AT 2000 has some exclusive features that make it a powerful and versatile network tester. Here are some of them:

- **Fiber support:** The LinkRunner AT 2000 can test fiber optic cables using SFP modules (sold separately). You can choose from a variety of SFP modules to test different types of fiber cables at different wavelengths and distances. You can also use the LinkRunner AT 2000 as a fiber optic light source or power meter.
- **TruePowerâ¢ PoE Power Test up to 30W:** The LinkRunner AT 2000 can measure the actual power delivered by a PoE device such as a switch or injector. It can also load the PoE device with up to 30W of power to verify its performance and stability. You can also test PoE devices that support the 802.3af/at standards or proprietary PoE schemes.
- **IPv6 support:** The LinkRunner AT 2000 can test IPv6 connectivity and configuration as well as IPv4. You can use the AutoTest feature to verify IPv6 address assignment, gateway, and DNS server availability. You can also ping or trace route to IPv6 addresses or hostnames.
- **Reflector support:** The LinkRunner AT 2000 can act as a packet reflector for performance tests conducted with other NetAlly products such as OneTouchâ¢ AT Network Assistant or AirCheckâ¢ G2 Wireless Tester. You can use the reflector mode to measure end-to-end network performance metrics such as throughput, latency, jitter, and packet loss.
- **More reports: 50 instead of 10:** The LinkRunner AT 2000 can store up to 50 test results in its internal memory, compared to 10 results for the LinkRunner AT 1000. You can also upload your test results to the Link-Live Cloud Service for easy access and management.
- **Uses Li-ION rechargeable battery instead of an AA battery pack:** The LinkRunner AT 2000 comes with a rechargeable lithium-ion battery pack that provides longer battery life and faster charging than the AA battery pack used by the LinkRunner AT 1000. You can also swap the battery pack with a spare one (sold separately) for uninterrupted testing.
