If you are looking for a way to mix music from your computer for free, you might want to try Virtual DJ 7.0.5. This software is one of the most downloaded DJ software on earth, with more than 147 million downloads[^3^]. It allows you to learn the basics of mixing music and create your own mashups with or without any hardware connected to your computer.
 
However, if you want to unlock the full potential of Virtual DJ 7.0.5, you will need a serial number. A serial number is a unique code that identifies your copy of the software and allows you to access all the features and updates. Without a serial number, you will only be able to use the trial version of Virtual DJ 7.0.5, which has some limitations and expires after 30 days.

So how can you find your Virtual DJ 7.0.5 serial number? There are a few ways to do this, depending on how you obtained the software.
 
- If you bought Virtual DJ 7.0.5 online from the official website[^3^], you should have received an email with your serial number after completing your purchase. Check your inbox and spam folder for this email and copy the serial number from there.
- If you bought Virtual DJ 7.0.5 from a physical store or a reseller, you should have received a box or a card with your serial number printed on it. Look for this box or card and copy the serial number from there.
- If you downloaded Virtual DJ 7.0.5 for free from a third-party website[^2^], you might have gotten a cracked version of the software that comes with a serial number generator or a patch. However, we do not recommend using these methods, as they are illegal and can harm your computer with viruses or malware. Moreover, they might not work properly with the latest updates and features of Virtual DJ 7.0.5.

Once you have your serial number, you can enter it in the software by clicking on the "Register" button on the top right corner of the interface. You will then be able to enjoy all the benefits of Virtual DJ 7.0.5, such as unlimited tracks, effects, samples, skins, plugins, controllers, and more.
