The plot of the film revolves around the aftermath of a one night stand between Urvil and Celina, who meet at a fashion show organised by Urvil's event management agency in Phuket, Thailand. Urvil is challenged by his friends to talk to Celina, who introduces herself as a mysterious stranger. They drink and dance together, and end up spending the night in a hotel room. The next morning, Urvil wakes up to find Celina gone, without leaving any contact details. He returns to his home in Pune, where he lives with his loving wife Simran (Nyra Banerjee). He tries to forget about Celina, but he can't get her out of his mind.
  
One day, he spots Celina in a mall where he has gone shopping with Simran. He follows her and discovers that she is actually Ambar Kapoor (Sunny Leone), the wife of his rich client Adhiraj Kapoor (Khalid Siddiqui), who lives in a posh villa with their young son Jahaan (Rehan Pathan) and Adhiraj's father Raghav (Kanwaljeet Singh). Urvil becomes obsessed with Ambar and starts stalking her, calling her from different numbers and sending her flowers. He even breaks into her house and leaves a note on her bed. Ambar is shocked and scared by Urvil's behaviour, and tries to avoid him. She confronts him and tells him that their one night stand was a mistake and that he should leave her alone.
  
Urvil refuses to listen to Ambar and continues to harass her. He even threatens to expose their affair to Adhiraj if she doesn't meet him again. He blackmails her into meeting him at a hotel room, where he tries to force himself on her. Ambar manages to escape and calls the police. Urvil is arrested and taken away. Simran finds out about Urvil's infidelity and leaves him. Urvil loses his job, his reputation and his family. He realises that he has ruined his life because of his obsession with Ambar. He regrets his actions and apologises to Ambar for his behaviour. He also writes a letter to Simran, asking for her forgiveness. The film ends with Urvil walking out of the police station, alone and broken.
